This application allows you to create a table of employees, from manager to intern.  You are able to input information and be able to return a team of 4 and see all their information.

The code passes all tests requied, and puts in all inputed information into a new html code that runs with the new information entered.

This also passes all test, and fills in the employee cards with information given by the user.

I was able to get pretty far, about 80% done.  I was not able to get the information passed into the employee cards, and used a tutor to help me in that area.

Once we where able to figure out how to connect the information to the employee cards, we then ran into the problem of failed test runs.

We where finally able to figure out passing test, passing information from the javascript into the employee cards and have everything work as needed.

Kinda sucks to use URL encoded links, this is because your file name is stupid and has spaces in it. Try renaming your picture to something better and then the link will look nicer, like this:
