I was able to get pretty far, about 80% done.  I was not able to get the information passed into the employee cards, and used a tutor to help me in that area.

Once we where able to figure out how to connect the information to the employee cards, we then ran into the problem of failed test runs.

We where finally able to figure out passing test, passing information from the javascript into the employee cards and have everything work as needed.

Please see the video of the working code that is located in the Assets folder.
